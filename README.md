# Kannada-Akshara-Parsing
Finds the most common akshara in a kannada file, and outputs the parsed file. 

To use, open the dist_new_2023 folder and run the padacheda.py file.

Output a file directory (some are provided in dist_new_2023/text). The default file is vayustuti_kan.txt

The console output will be the most common akshara, and the number of times it occurs in the file.
In input_file_directory/parsed_text.txt, there will be a parsed version of the input file, separated by commas.
